We exploit the mixed-integer optimization-representability of many machine learning methods, including linear models, decision trees, ensembles, and multi-layer perceptrons, which allows us to capture various underlying relationships between decisions, contextual variables, and outcomes. We also introduce two approaches for handling the inherent uncertainty of learning from data. First, we characterize a decision trust region using the convex hull of the observations, to ensure credible recommendations and avoid extrapolation. We efficiently incorporate this representation using column generation and propose a more flexible formulation to deal with low-density regions and high-dimensional datasets. Then, we propose an ensemble learning approach that enforces constraint satisfaction over multiple bootstrapped estimators or multiple algorithms. In combination with domain-driven components, the embedded models and trust region define a mixed-integer optimization problem for prescription generation.

Consider a setting where we want to recommend a diet, defined by a combination of foods and quantities, that is sufficiently 'palatable.'

Importantly, many popular ML methods result in functions that are MIO-representable, meaning that they can be embedded into MIO formulations. This MIOrepresentable class includes both linear and nonlinear models, allowing us to capture a broad set of underlying relationships in the data. While the idea of learning functions directly from data is core to the field of ML, data is often underutilized in MIO settings due to the need for functional relationships between decision variables and outcomes. We seek to bridge this gap through constraint learning ; we propose a general framework that allows us to learn constraints and objectives directly from data, using ML, and to optimize decisions accordingly, using MIO.\nOnce the learned constraints have been incorporated into the larger MIO, we can solve the problem directly using off-the-shelf solvers."

Some authors have presented a more general framework of embedding learned ML models in optimization problems such as JANOS (Bergman et al. 2022) and EML (Lombardi et al. 2017), but in practice these works are restricted to limited problem structures and learned model classes. We take a broader perspective, proposing a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline that encompasses the full ML and optimization components of a data-driven decision making problem. In contrast to EML and JANOS, OptiCL supports a wider variety of predictive models - neural networks (with ReLU), linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosted trees and linear support vector machines. OptiCL is also more flexible than JANOS, as it can handle predictive models as constraints, and it also incorporates new concepts to deal with uncertainty in the ML models.

The code is available at https://github.com/hwiberg/OptiCL . The software encompasses the full ML and optimization pipeline with the goal of being accessible to end users as well as extensible by technical researchers. Our framework natively supports models for both regression and classification functions and handles constraint learning in cases with both one-class and two-class data. We implement a cross-validation procedure for function learning that selects from a broad set of model classes. We also implement the optimization procedure in the generic mathematical modeling library Pyomo, which supports various state-of-the-art solvers. We introduce two approaches for handling the inherent uncertainty when learning from data. First, we propose an ensemble learning approach that enforces constraint satisfaction over an ensemble of multiple bootstrapped estimators or multiple algorithms, yielding more robust solutions.

We offer several improvements to a basic convex hull formulation, including a clustering heuristic and a column selection algorithm that significantly reduce computation time. We also propose an enlargement of the convex hull which allows for exploration of solutions outside of the observed bounds. Both the ensemble model wrapper and trust region enlargement are controlled by parameters that allow an end user to directly trade-off the conservativeness of the constraint satisfaction.\n2.

The large dataset used in this case study makes the use of the trust region expensive in terms of time required to solve the final optimization model. While the column selection algorithm described in Section 2.3 is ideal for significantly reducing the computation time, optimization models that require binary variables, either for embedding an ML model or to represent decision variables, would require column selection to be combined with a branch and bound algorithm. However, in this more general MIO case, it is possible to divide the dataset into clusters and solve in parallel an MIO for each cluster. By using parallelization, the total solution time can be expected to be equal to the longest time required to solve any single cluster's MIO. Contrary to column selection, the use of clusters can result in more conservative solutions; the trust region gets smaller with more clusters and prevents the model from finding solutions that are convex combinations of members of different clusters. However, as described in Section 2.3, solutions that lie between clusters may in fact reside in low-density areas of the feature space that should not be included in the trust region. In this sense, the loss in the objective value might actually coincide with more trustable solutions."

As expected, improvements in palatability (when \u03b1 decreases) lead to increases in the total cost. However, we observe that a violation limit of 0.0 (vs. 0.5) leads to an 11.3% improvement in real palatability (20.8% improvement in predicted palatability), with a relatively modest 2.5% increase in cost. The center and right figure show how palatability and violations vary with \u03b1 . Palatability increases and violations decease with lower \u03b1 . Both the violation rate (proportion of iterations with real palatability < 0 . 5) and violation margin (average distance to palatability threshold in cases where there is a violation) decrease with lower \u03b1 .

In this work we leverage a richer class of ML methods and more granular outcome measures. This offers benefits through higher performing predictive models and more clinically-relevant constraints.\nChemotherapy regimens are particularly challenging to optimize, since they involve multiple drugs given at potentially varying dosages, and they present risks for multiple adverse events that must be managed. This example highlights the generalizability of our framework to complex domains with multiple decisions and learned functions. The treatment variables in this problem consist of both binary and continuous elements, which are easily incorporated through our use of MIO.

In order to evaluate the quality of our prescriptions, we must estimate the outcomes under various treatment alternatives. This evaluation task is notoriously challenging due to the lack of counterfactuals. In particular, we only know the true outcomes for observed cohort-treatment pairs and do not have information on potential unobserved combinations. We propose an evaluation scheme that leverages a 'ground truth' ensemble (GT ensemble). We train several ML models using all data from the study. These models are not embedded in an MIO model, so we are able to consider a broader set of methods in the ensemble. We then predict each outcome by averaging across all models in the ensemble. This approach allows us to capture the maximal knowledge scenario. Furthermore, such a 'consensus' approach of combining ML models has been shown to improve predictive performance and is more robust to individual model error (Bertsimas et al. 2021). The full details of the ensemble models and their predictive performances are included in Appendix D.3."

Discussion\nOur experimental results illustrate the benefits of our constraint learning framework in datadriven decision making in two problem settings: food basket recommendations for the WFP and chemotherapy regimens for advanced gastric cancer. The quantitative results show an improvement in predictive performance when incorporating the trust region and learning from multiple candidate model classes. Our framework scales to large problem sizes, enabled by efficient formulations and tailored approaches to specific problem structures. Our approach for efficiently learning the trust region also has broad applicability in one-class constraint learning.\nThe nominal problem formulation is strengthened by embedding multiple models for a single constraint rather than relying on a single learned function. This notion of robustness is particularly important in the context of learning constraints: whereas mis-specfications in learned objective functions can lead to suboptimal outcomes, a mis-specified constraint can lead to infeasible solutions. Finally, our software exposes the model ensemble construction and trust region enlargement options directly through user-specified parameters. This allows an end user to directly evaluate tradeoffs in objective value and constraint satisfaction, as the problem's real-world context often shapes the level of desired conservatism."

This can be problematic in the case of model misspecification, a known shortcoming of 'predict-then-optimize' methods (Elmachtoub and Grigas 2021). We mitigate this concern in two ways. First, our model selection procedure allows us to obtain higher quality predictive models by capturing several possible functional relationships. Second, our model wrapper approach for embedding a single constraint with an ensemble of models allows us to directly control our robustness to the predictions of individual learners. In future work, there is an opportunity to incorporate ideas from robust optimization to directly account for prediction uncertainty in individual model classes. While this has been addressed in the linear case (Goldfarb and Iyengar 2003), it remains an open area of research in more general ML methods."

Our work flexibly learns problem constraints and objectives with supervised learning, and incorporates them into a larger optimization problem of interest. We also learn the trust region, providing more credible recommendations and improving predictive performance, and accomplish this efficiently using column generation and unsupervised learning. The generality of our method allows us to tackle quite complex decision settings, such as chemotherapy optimization, but also includes tailored approaches for more efficiently solving specific problem types. Finally, we implement this as a Python software package ( OptiCL ) to enable practitioner use. We envision that OptiCL 's methodology will be added to state-of-the-art optimization modeling software packages."

In general, we recommend defining the feasible region with respect to both \u00af x and \u00af w . This ensures that our prescriptions are reasonable with respect to the contextual variables as well. Note that for different values of w , the convex hull in the x space may be different. In Figure EC.2, the shaded region represents the convex hull of Z formed by the dataset (blue dots), and the red line represents the set of trusted solutions when w is fixed to a certain value. In Figure EC.2a, we see that the set of trusted solutions (red line) lies within CH( Z ) when we include \u00af w . If we leave out \u00af w in the definition of the trust region, then we end up with the undesired situation shown in Figure EC.2b, where the solution may lie outside of CH( Z ). We observe that in some cases we must define the convex hull with a subset of variables.

Constraints (18d-18f) define the trust region based on N datapoints. Figure EC.3 shows the computation time required to solve P exp with different values of n , k , and N . The 'No Column Selection' approach consists of solving P exp using the entire dataset. The 'Column Selection' approach makes use of Algorithm 1 to solve the problem, starting with |I 0 | =100, and selecting only one sample at each iteration, i.e. , the one with the most negative reduced cost. It can be seen that in all cases, the use of column selection results in significantly improved computation times.

Table EC.5 reports the change in objective value (cost) and constrained outcome (palatbility) between the nominal and bootstrapped solution with 10 estimators and a violation limit of 25%. The goal of the WFP case study is to minimize cost such that palatability is at least 0.5; thus, a smaller cost and larger palatability are better. As expected, the robust solution increases both the cost and palatability of the prescribed diets. We see that the relative increase in cost is consistently lower than the relative increase in real palatability across all methods, indicating that the improvement in palatability exceeds the incremental cost addition. While the acceptable trade off between cost and palatability could differ by use case, this could be further explored with alternative violation limits. Additionally, we compare the single algorithm constraints against an ensemble of all six methods, also with a violation limit of \u03b1 =0 . 25. The ensemble with multiple algorithms yields an objective value of 1313 and real palatability of 0.57. This represents a -1.8% to 1% increase in cost and 5.6% to 15.6% increase"

We see that the RF and GBM models have reasonable median solve times (6.66 and 18.80 minutes, respectively), but the average solve times are driven up by outlier instances that have significantly higher runtimes (max. 2110 and 1603 minutes, respectively). We propose to use a time limit to control the experiment times. On the right side of the table, we see that using a 4 hour time limit returns optimal solutions for 95% of the RF runs and 82% of the GBM runs, and feasible solutions for all but four GBM instances. In cases where an optimal solution is obtained, the average runtime is less than 40 minutes. In cases where the time limit is hit, the average remaining MIP gap is 1.02% for RF and 5.21% for GBM. The results suggest that imposing this termination condition results in high quality solutions with a modest optimality gap."

Constraints (21f), (21g) and (21h) are used to compute the average CPI for a core k , the average CPI for the cores in the neighborhood of k ( N ( k )), and the average CPI for cores not in the neighborhood of k respectively. Lombardi et al. (2017) conclude that learning the efficiency function for each core by means of neural networks (with one hidden layer of two nodes and tanh activation function) is computationally intractable. On the contrary, our experiments show that we are able to solve this problem using neural networks with one hidden layer and 10 nodes in a reasonable amount of time (19.4 seconds). We tried deeper neural networks, but the increase in computational complexity did not lead to a gain in predictive performance."
